# Recurrent Neural Networks
## Short Reading
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) differ from CNNs by taking into consideration previous inputs for the current prediction. Because of this trait, they generally perform well on data with temporal features, and generally perform much worse than CNNs for data with only spatial features (e.g. image recognition).

Thus, sequence to sequence or sequence generation are usually done using recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM.
